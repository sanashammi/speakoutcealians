### Implementation
For Software:We implemented the anti-bullying website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an interactive and user-friendly platform. The website features a mental health support chatbot, developed using JavaScript, to provide real-time assistance to users seeking help. To enable anonymous reporting, we integrated a report issue button, which allows users to submit their concerns through a form that sends the details directly to the author‚Äôs email using JavaScript and an email service. Additionally, we included an informational section that educates users about anti-bullying laws in India, designed with HTML and CSS for readability and accessibility. The overall design ensures a safe, supportive, and easy-to-navigate space for users affected by bullying.
